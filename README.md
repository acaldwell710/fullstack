# fullstack
Full Stack Development with MEAN is a full-stack application featuring a SPA.

# Architecture
The client-facing front end website utilizes Express (Node), Handlebars templates, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB and Mongoose. These technologies work cohesively to create an MVC, model, view, controller,  framework for the full stack application with the addition of the database. The client is able to visit the website and see multiple HTML pages each styled with CSS using the Express framework. In the single-page application or SPA, another JavaScript framework called Angular is used. The angular modules create organization for the SPA. REST API calls featuring CRUD are transmitting to the NoSQL database and can be executed by authorized users with the use of JSON web tokens (JWT). Additionally, The SPA utilizes bootstrap for styling.

This project requires the use of a MEAN stack. Therefore, this requires a MongoDB database. In addition to the MEAN stack, MongoDB has a flexible schema and allows API calls with JSON.
